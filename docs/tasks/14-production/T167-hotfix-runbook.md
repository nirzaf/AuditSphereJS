# T167 — Create the source-controlled hotfix and incident-repair workflow

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Initial status | `NOT_STARTED` |
| Execution class | `GATE` |
| Phase | 14-production — Production verification, migration and release |
| Owner area | `operations` |
| Completion unit | One focused, reviewable change and its evidence |

## Outcome

Document minimal fix, focused regression, typecheck/build, authorization, deploy and smoke sequence.

## Required context and prerequisites

Read [root agent rules](../../AGENTS.md), this task, the owning module README when it exists, and the exact relevant source ranges in [the preserved CURRENT requirements](../../sources/requirements-current.md). Do not load every task into the agent context.

- [T166 — Rehearse rolling deployment, realtime reconnect and worker drains](T166-rolling-deploy.md)

A dependency must be `DONE`, or an optional/conditional dependency must have an explicitly approved `NOT_APPLICABLE` disposition. All domain implementation also requires [the executable compatibility gate](../01-foundation/T017-compatibility-smoke.md) to pass. Policy-dependent behavior stays blocked until its applicable decisions are approved.

## Source requirements

- **R002** — Five connected business modules; source lines `68-129`.
- **R072** — Timestamped immutable audit events; source lines `552-552`.

These are coverage identifiers added by this pack; they do not alter the source specification. Review [policy/source conflicts](../../guides/05-decisions-and-source-conflicts.md) when wording overlaps.

## Scope and implementation boundary

**Allowed areas:** Runbooks; deployment/recovery automation; audited operational evidence

**Non-goals:** A task document or stored codeword is not approval to merge, release, delete or repair production data.

Use existing owned records/contracts first. Add a migration or public endpoint only when the task steps require it; record the exact files in the handoff.

**Dependency focus:** Reuse the dependencies already approved for this owner area; no new library is required merely to complete this task.

Use [the compatibility policy](../../guides/02-compatibility-matrix.md) and [the complete library register](../../guides/03-library-register.md). Newly introduced or updated packages need published engine/peer/license/advisory review and an executable smoke check before use. Exact lockfile versions, not this task's prose, control installation.

**Applicable decisions:** Check the decision register for any applicable unresolved policy; do not invent a default.

## Implementation checklist

- [ ] Document minimal fix, focused regression, typecheck/build, authorization, deploy and smoke sequence.
- [ ] Keep code rollback distinct from reviewed database/data-repair procedures.
- [ ] Require explicit production authorization and the project merge codeword where merge is requested; a task file is not that authorization.
- [ ] Record incidents, affected records and remediation evidence without normalizing direct live-file editing.

## Acceptance criteria and required tests

- [ ] **AC1:** A simulated urgent fix uses the same immutable release pipeline.
- [ ] **AC2:** Unapproved production/data-changing commands are stopped.
- [ ] **AC3:** Incident repair can identify exactly which records were affected.

Rehearse before live action and record authorized operators, actual artifacts, smoke results and rollback bounds.

Test both the successful change and the denied/failure path. Keep the test set proportional to the task; use the actual PostgreSQL engine for financial constraints, locking and concurrent-write claims.

## Failure, rollback and recovery

Fail without a partial successful business state. Keep committed history and evidence immutable; return a clear error or a durable recoverable operation. Source/code rollback does not undo database migrations, financial postings, signed files or external side effects. Any production data repair is a separately authorized operation.

## Verification and handoff

Once [the verification command contract](../01-foundation/T015-commands.md) exists, run the exact task check:

```bash
pnpm verify:task -- T167
```

Before that script exists, record the actual available compile/test/review commands instead. The command above is a **target repository script to implement**, not a claim that an application is included in this ZIP. A verification run must not pass with zero intended tests.

Record changed files, migrations/contracts, exact command output, fixture versions, unresolved decisions and limitations using [the handoff template](../../templates/task-handoff.md). Update [the execution ledger](../../guides/13-execution-ledger.md) only after review. Do not merge or deploy from this task without separate authorization.

**Stop when:** the scoped outcome and all acceptance criteria are proven. Do not continue into the next feature or add unrelated abstractions.
