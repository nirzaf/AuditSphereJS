# T153 — Implement staff lookup or synchronization without privilege escalation

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Initial status | `NOT_STARTED` |
| Execution class | `OPTIONAL` |
| Phase | 13-microsoft365 — Optional Microsoft 365 integration |
| Owner area | `microsoft365` |
| Completion unit | One focused, reviewable change and its evidence |

> Optional extension. Implement only when enabled and approved; otherwise retain an explicit `NOT_APPLICABLE` decision.

## Outcome

Read only approved tenant users/groups with least-privilege Graph permissions.

## Required context and prerequisites

Read [root agent rules](../../AGENTS.md), this task, the owning module README when it exists, and the exact relevant source ranges in [the preserved CURRENT requirements](../../sources/requirements-current.md). Do not load every task into the agent context.

- [T150 — Verify MSAL and Graph packages against the selected Angular/Node stack](T150-m365-compatibility.md)
- [T018 — Implement firm, client and engagement ownership constraints](../02-security/T018-scope-model.md)

A dependency must be `DONE`, or an optional/conditional dependency must have an explicitly approved `NOT_APPLICABLE` disposition. All domain implementation also requires [the executable compatibility gate](../01-foundation/T017-compatibility-smoke.md) to pass. Policy-dependent behavior stays blocked until its applicable decisions are approved.

## Source requirements

- **R029** — Engagement team roles; source lines `451-451`.

These are coverage identifiers added by this pack; they do not alter the source specification. Review [policy/source conflicts](../../guides/05-decisions-and-source-conflicts.md) when wording overlaps.

## Scope and implementation boundary

**Allowed areas:** packages/server/src/platform/microsoft365/; selected web auth adapter; isolated integration tests

**Non-goals:** Only enabled approved integration scope; no production tenant mutations or blanket administrator consent.

Use existing owned records/contracts first. Add a migration or public endpoint only when the task steps require it; record the exact files in the handoff.

**Dependency focus:** Reuse the dependencies already approved for this owner area; no new library is required merely to complete this task.

Use [the compatibility policy](../../guides/02-compatibility-matrix.md) and [the complete library register](../../guides/03-library-register.md). Newly introduced or updated packages need published engine/peer/license/advisory review and an executable smoke check before use. Exact lockfile versions, not this task's prose, control installation.

**Applicable decisions:** Check the decision register for any applicable unresolved policy; do not invent a default.

## Implementation checklist

- [ ] Read only approved tenant users/groups with least-privilege Graph permissions.
- [ ] Store immutable directory IDs and sync provenance; deactivate local eligibility when policy requires.
- [ ] Make engagement assignments explicit in AuditSphere rather than blindly inheriting directory groups.
- [ ] Scope caches/delta cursors by tenant and protect them against cross-tenant reuse.

## Acceptance criteria and required tests

- [ ] **AC1:** Only approved tenant identities can be synchronized.
- [ ] **AC2:** Directory role changes do not bypass local sign-off policy.
- [ ] **AC3:** Revoked/disabled access is reflected under the agreed refresh policy.

Require exact SDK peer/install evidence and least-privilege credentialed nonproduction tests for enabled endpoints.

Test both the successful change and the denied/failure path. Keep the test set proportional to the task; use the actual PostgreSQL engine for financial constraints, locking and concurrent-write claims.

## Failure, rollback and recovery

Fail without a partial successful business state. Keep committed history and evidence immutable; return a clear error or a durable recoverable operation. Source/code rollback does not undo database migrations, financial postings, signed files or external side effects. Any production data repair is a separately authorized operation.

## Verification and handoff

Once [the verification command contract](../01-foundation/T015-commands.md) exists, run the exact task check:

```bash
pnpm verify:task -- T153
```

Before that script exists, record the actual available compile/test/review commands instead. The command above is a **target repository script to implement**, not a claim that an application is included in this ZIP. A verification run must not pass with zero intended tests.

Record changed files, migrations/contracts, exact command output, fixture versions, unresolved decisions and limitations using [the handoff template](../../templates/task-handoff.md). Update [the execution ledger](../../guides/13-execution-ledger.md) only after review. Do not merge or deploy from this task without separate authorization.

**Stop when:** the scoped outcome and all acceptance criteria are proven. Do not continue into the next feature or add unrelated abstractions.
