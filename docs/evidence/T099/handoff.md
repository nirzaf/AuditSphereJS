# Task handoff

## Identity

Task ID: T099 — Monetary-unit sampling
Requirement IDs: per the task card (docs/tasks/)
Implementing commit/branch: main, the commit that adds this handoff
Status: IN_REVIEW (ledger). This handoff records the recipe added for the DoD recipe rule; it is not an acceptance review.

## Intended and delivered outcome

Adds the recorded verification recipe in `scripts/verify-task.mjs` for T099, so `pnpm verify:task -- T099` runs the checks this task depends on. selectMonetaryUnit is covered by the unit suite, including the interval and key-item cases.

## Files and contracts

- `scripts/verify-task.mjs`: the T099 recipe.
- No migration, contract or dependency change for this entry.

## Decisions

Recipe rule: docs/07-definition-of-done-additions.md item 1 (proposed). Adoption is owner-pending; the recipe was added because the current AGENTS.md requires one per task.

## Executed verification

| Command | Actual result |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pnpm verify:task -- T099` (build:server, sampling (tests/sampling.test.ts, unit)) | exit 0 on 2026-10-08 |

## Acceptance criteria

Not re-reviewed here. The recipe proves the listed tests run and pass; it does not prove the card's acceptance criteria against a reviewer's reading.

## Review and next task

Reviewer: pending independent review

Open blockers: independent review of the card acceptance criteria.
