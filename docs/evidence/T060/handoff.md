# Task handoff

## Identity

Task ID: T060 — Pure fee model and approval matrix
Requirement IDs: per the task card (docs/tasks/)
Implementing commit/branch: main, the commit that adds this handoff
Status: IN_REVIEW (ledger). This handoff records the recipe added for the DoD recipe rule; it is not an acceptance review.

## Intended and delivered outcome

Adds the recorded verification recipe in `scripts/verify-task.mjs` for T060, so `pnpm verify:task -- T060` runs the checks this task depends on. The pure fee model and approval matrix are covered by the unit suite. The commercial workflow around quotations is not covered by this recipe.

## Files and contracts

- `scripts/verify-task.mjs`: the T060 recipe.
- No migration, contract or dependency change for this entry.

## Decisions

Recipe rule: docs/07-definition-of-done-additions.md item 1 (proposed). Adoption is owner-pending; the recipe was added because the current AGENTS.md requires one per task.

## Executed verification

| Command | Actual result |
| :--- | :--- |
| `pnpm verify:task -- T060` (build:server, quotation (tests/quotation.test.ts, unit)) | exit 0 on 2026-10-08 |

## Acceptance criteria

Not re-reviewed here. The recipe proves the listed tests run and pass; it does not prove the card's acceptance criteria against a reviewer's reading.

## Recovery and authorization

No data or migration change. No merge or deployment is authorized by this handoff.

## Review and next task

Reviewer: pending independent review
Review result: pending
Open blockers: independent review of the card acceptance criteria.
Next eligible task by dependency order: not assigned.
Stop after this task; do not implement the next one without assignment.
